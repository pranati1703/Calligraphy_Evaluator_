Perfect scores (2 points) should be extremely rare and reserved only for work that demonstrates absolute mastery. Even accomplished calligraphers rarely achieve perfect scores. A total score above 8 should be exceptional and uncommon.

Score the following 4 factors for a maximum total of 8 points, give total score at the end. Do not provide any summary or title.

Consistent Stroke Pressure (2 points)
- 2 points (EXCEPTIONAL):  
  "The stroke thickness transitions smoothly from 5 times thicker downstroke to a hairline-thin upstroke. No pressure variations or wobbling. Downstrokes must appear perfectly parallel, and upstrokes must be hairline thin."
- 1.5 points (ADVANCED):  
  "Thick-to-thin ratio is at least 4:1 with a maximum of two slight variations in thickness (up to 10% deviation). All transitions appear smooth under close inspection."
- 1 point (INTERMEDIATE):  
  "Thick-to-thin ratio is approximately 3:1, but there are 3â€“4 clear inconsistencies in pressure within individual strokes. Noticeable wobbling."
- 0.5 points (BEGINNER):  
  "The thick-to-thin ratio falls to 2:1 or lower, with 5 or more strokes showing clear wobbling or inconsistent pressure."
- 0 points (FUNDAMENTAL):  
  "Strokes are mostly uniform in width or vary randomly, with no controlled transitions between thick and thin areas."

Cohesive Strokes (2 points)
- 2 points (EXCEPTIONAL):  
  "Strokes must maintain perfectly smooth, uninterrupted lines, with no visible tremors, wobbles, or hesitations when magnified. Each stroke maintains a uniform width as intended."
- 1.5 points (ADVANCED):  
  "Up to two minor wobbles or tremors are allowed, but strokes should remain mostly smooth. Any width variations should be minimal (less than 5% of intended stroke width)."
- 1 point (INTERMEDIATE):  
  "Three to four strokes show visible deviations from the intended path, with noticeable tremors or inconsistent width in places."
- 0.5 points (BEGINNER):  
  "Five or more strokes display significant tremors or hesitation marks, with uneven ink flow leading to inconsistent width throughout."
- 0 points (FUNDAMENTAL):  
  "Most strokes are shaky, with clear tremors or uneven pressure throughout, lacking any sign of controlled or intentional movement."

Stroke Consistency (2 points):
2 points: EXCEPTIONAL (Rare) - All measurements match within 0.5mm. Perfect x-height ratio. Slant angle consistent within 1 degree. Spacing exactly matches the intended design.
1.5 points: ADVANCED - Measurements within 1mm of ideal. X-height ratio within 5% deviation. Slant consistent within 2-3 degrees. Spacing varies by less than 1mm.
1 point: INTERMEDIATE - Measurements deviate 1-2mm from ideal. X-height ratio varies by 5-10%. Slant varies by 3-5 degrees. Spacing varies by 1-2mm.
0.5 points: BEGINNER - Measurements off by 2-3mm. X-height ratio varies by 10-20%. Slant varies by 5-10 degrees. Spacing varies by 2-3mm.
0 points: FUNDAMENTAL - Measurements deviate more than 3mm. X-height ratio varies by over 20%. Slant varies by over 10 degrees. Spacing varies by over 3mm.

Cursive Style Requirement (2 points):
2 points: EXCEPTIONAL (Rare) - Writing demonstrates continuous cursive flow throughout. Letters are connected smoothly with no interruptions, maintaining consistent flow between characters.
1.5 points: ADVANCED - Writing is mostly cursive, but up to two minor breaks or inconsistencies in letter connections are visible.
1 point: INTERMEDIATE - Writing shows multiple breaks, with three to four disconnected letters or interruptions in flow.
0.5 points: BEGINNER - Writing is partially cursive but shows five or more disconnected letters or printed characteristics.
0 points: FUNDAMENTAL - Writing is predominantly printed, with no consistent attempt at cursive flow between letters.

For each category, to award points, you must explicitly confirm that the work matches the criteria in all measured aspects for that category."""
